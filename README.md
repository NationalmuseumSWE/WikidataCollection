# Nationalmuseum Sweden Wikidata Collection 

The collection of the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm are largely accessible at Europeana. A part of this collection, data concerning some 4500 paintings, has been imported to Wikidata and linked to high-resolution, public domain images depicting the paintings as well as to  the respective artists and articles. The Nationalmuseum here provides the LIDO-xml on which the original Wikidata import was based. The dataset included links to the images on Wikimedia Commons as well as to iiif resources on iiifhosting. The metadata includes artist, title, media- and dimension information and often information on the depicted persons. The information has been collected in the internal database of the Nationalmuseum and might be incomplete or erratic. Additional data or corrections are welcome. The dataset is reachable on [Wikidata](http://tools.wmflabs.org/autolist/autolist1.html?props=217&q=CLAIM%5B195%3A842858%5D)
